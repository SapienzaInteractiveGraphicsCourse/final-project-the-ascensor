The project was realized using the library three.js. The goal was to make a 3D game. In the game, we will play the role of Steve a raccoon runner. The user will have the ability to move Steve through the keys A and D also balloons will appear on the screen, if we click them, they will burst and provide a speed boost to Steve. In the main scene, there are various trees, a track and a model for the finish line has been created. There is also a tribune on which there are various animals, each with a different model and a different animation, that will cheer for Steve and the other raccoons in the race.
